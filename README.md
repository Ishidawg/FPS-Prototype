# FPS Prototye ðŸ”«
> **A FPS prototype using Ursina Game Engine**

I have decided to create a 3D game, which is, in fact, my first attempt at developing a 3D game, using a different framework/engine. The last time I made a game, I used the PyGame framework, and it was quite enjoyable, but I am unsure whether I could create a 3D game with it. Therefore, after conducting some research, I discovered the Ursina Game Engine (which lacks a UI, so I do not believe it is an engine per se, but rather a framework).

This idea also stemmed from my love for game modding. Thus, in addition to learning more about game development and enhancing my skills as a programmer, I aim to improve my abilities in UI & UX, 3D Modeling (using Blender), creating textures in various artistic styles, etc.!.

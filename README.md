# FPS Prototye ðŸ”«
> A FPS prototype made in Ursina when I was lost in thoughts and did not knew what to do with my career.

I was learning some *3D modeling* on [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and  decide to use my **professional assets on a game**. I know python a bit and has made a [project](https://github.com/Ishidawg/Asteroids-Survival) using [`pyGame`](https://www.pygame.org/news) back in the day, so python even thought is not a good language to create games, was a obvious choice *to me*, so I've discovered [Ursina](https://www.ursinaengine.org/) a *"Python powered, open source game engine"*.

*Maybe I come back here some day and finish this, maybe not in python, may in python, perhaps, how knows crap these days...*
